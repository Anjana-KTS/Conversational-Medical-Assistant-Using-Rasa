# Conversational-Medical-Assistant-Using-Rasa
This repository contains the implementation of a Conversational Medical Assistant, designed to provide preliminary medical assistance using a chatbot framework. Built with the Rasa Open Source Framework and integrated with a Neo4j knowledge graph, this project demonstrates the practical application of natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue management, and structured data in delivering impactful healthcare solutions


# Features
Natural Language Understanding (NLU):

Configured pipelines for intent classification, entity extraction, and synonym mapping using Rasaâ€™s powerful NLU components. Handles user intents such as symptom inquiry, disease prediction, medication suggestions, and appointment scheduling.


Dialogue Management:

Implemented custom stories and rules for seamless conversation flow. Supported fallback mechanisms for unrecognized intents and ambiguous user inputs. 


Neo4j Knowledge Graph Integration:

The chatbot retrieves structured medical information using a Neo4j database, enhancing its contextual understanding and providing accurate responses. The knowledge graph connects entities like symptoms, diseases, medications, and treatments to ensure comprehensive data retrieval.


Custom Actions:

Implemented server-side actions to query Neo4j and dynamically generate responses tailored to user queries.
Leveraged Python scripts to establish connectivity with the Neo4j database via the Neo4j Python driver.


Scalable Architecture:

Designed to support integration with various front-end interfaces such as web applications, mobile apps, or voice assistants.
Configured Rasa's endpoints for real-time interactions and API integrations.
